 *The AVBio Package*

The AVBioscripts package is a continually evolving set of functions that I have written to assist in efficient data analysis.  These are mainly focused on standardized analyses such as the ddCt method for gene expression analysis, and can additionally assist in the quality control steps.

Currently this package has functions for:

* Assessing RNA purity for samples with an emphasis on Nanodrop readouts.

* Calculating cDNA reactions for each sample.

* Providing densitometry for shearing gels (mainly for ChIP)

* ddCt Gene expression analysis with biological replicates

* Percent of Total Input ChIP analysis with biological replicates

At some point I would like to open this package to a wider community as these functions are refined towards more general applications.  If you have an interest in discussing these future applications or how these functions are built, please contact me! I would be happy to discuss it.
