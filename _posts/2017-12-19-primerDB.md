 **PrimerDB is now accessible**

Over the weekend, the initial Shiny app for [PrimerDB was started on Shinyapps](https://avonhan.shinyapps.io/primer_dashboard/).  There is a lot of work that still remains, but the initialization provides enough functionality to query the DB efficiently and to find missing information that is needed for a primer DB.  For more information, [check out the basic writeup at the project page](https://avhgenomics.github.io/PrimerDB/)
