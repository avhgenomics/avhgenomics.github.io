# What is PrimerDB?

<section>
PrimerDB is a project I started developing when our group began the process of updating / reorganizing our collection of primers.  As time goes on, tubes inevitably get placed in wrong locations, etc. PrimerDB was made to create an easy to search, efficient database that can be updated in a streamlined format.
